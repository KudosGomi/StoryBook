## Python Story Book Application for a Friend's Psychology CS Course 📔👧🏽

A friend of mine who was majoring in pyshcology had to take a CS course for her degree plan.
At the time she was very busy and had asked me to create then final project for her. 
The course was a not an advanced CS course so anything created in the Python programming language was perfectly fine.
After completeing the project, I took the time to teach my friend every line of code since at the time she had learned a good grasp of Python due to her course and dedication she applied up until the final project. 

The program imitates a book in which the reader/user can select different phrases that conjunct together and creates a small short summary at the end with all the different phrases that were selected by the user. The program mimics pages of a book and tell a story with different options.
